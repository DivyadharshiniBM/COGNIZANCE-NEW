PROBLEM -1:

Write pseudocode and flowchart for a program that outputs ‘True’ if a given number is divisible by 3 and ‘False’ otherwise, 
without using the ‘%’ operator explicitly (like N % 3 == 0).

SOLUTION:

PSEUDOCODE:

* First get the number from the user
 1] IF THE NUMBER IS +VE :

* keep on subtracting 3 and check if it becomes 0 before becoming -ve.

* keep on subtracting multiples of 3 and return true if it becomes 0. Return false if it becomes -2, -1, 0, 1, 2.

* change the base to 3 and see if its last digit becomes 0.

 2] IF THE NUMBER IS -VE :

*multiply it by -1 and follow above steps
